description: This resource provides information about a  MATLAB program that calculates
  the dynanamic concentration and temperature profiles within a continuous stirred-tank
  reactor. This program models a CSTR in overflow mode (no volume change), or, if
  the flow rate is set to zero, the model simulates a batch reactor.
