description: This resource provides information about a  MATLAB m-file that contains
  a function that implements a particularly simple form of a quasi-Newton minimization
  routine employing finite difference estimates of the Hessian, a Levenberg-Marquardt
  type of modification to ensure that each search direction is a descent direction,
  and a secant method for the line search.
