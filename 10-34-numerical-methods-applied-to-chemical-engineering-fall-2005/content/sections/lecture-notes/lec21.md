description: This resource provides information about a procedure that calculates
  the components in the DAE form that discretize the boundary conditions on the PDE's.
  These are governed by the locations where epsilon(k) is zero. This procedure implements
  Dankwert's boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet of a 1-D tubular reactor.
