description: This resource provides information about a  MATLAB function that uses
  only standard MATLAB routines to implement the nonlinear fitting of parameters using
  the Marquardt method. And the errors for each response measurement are assumed to
  be independently distributed according to a normal distribution with a mean of zero
  and a common variance.
