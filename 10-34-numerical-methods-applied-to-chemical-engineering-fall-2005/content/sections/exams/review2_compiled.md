description: This resource provides information about iterative rules for updating
  trajectory with the objective of getting numerical solution to equal to the integration
  of the exact solution, converting higher-order differential equations into systems
  of coupled first-order differential equations, polynomial interpolation, Lagrange
  interpolation, optimization, and PDE-BVPs.
